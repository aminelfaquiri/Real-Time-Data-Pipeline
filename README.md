# Real-Time-Data-Pipeline
## Introduction :
In a rapidly evolving world where data is often referred to as the new currency, the ability to process, analyze, and make informed decisions based on real-time data is crucial for businesses and organizations. The Real-Time Data Pipeline project provides a practical solution for data professionals seeking to implement end-to-end data pipelines that can handle streaming data in real-time.

Whether you're a data engineer, data scientist, or developer, this project offers hands-on experience in building a data pipeline that combines various technologies and components, including PySpark, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, and data visualization tools. Through this project, you'll learn how to set up a real-time data processing environment, transform and aggregate data, and gain valuable insights that can drive decision-making.

## Planning
## Requirements Expression :
Before you begin with the Real-Time Data Pipeline project, ensure that you have the following requirements and dependencies in place:

- **Apache Spark (PySpark):** Make sure you have Apache Spark installed and configured. You can download Spark from the official website: [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).

- **Kafka:** Set up a Kafka broker or cluster for data streaming. You can install Kafka using the official documentation: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).

- **Cassandra:** Install and configure Cassandra for storing and retrieving data. You can get Cassandra from the official website: [Apache Cassandra] (https://cassandra.apache.org/download/).

- **MongoDB:** Set up MongoDB to store data for real-time analytics. Download MongoDB from the official website: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

- **Docker (Optional):** Consider using Docker to simplify the setup of Kafka, Cassandra, and MongoDB. You can find Docker images for these services on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

- **Java Dependencies:** Some components may require Java dependencies. Ensure that Java is installed and properly configured on your system.

- **Python Dependencies:** Install the necessary Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and interaction with Spark and databases. You can use Python package managers like `pip` to install the required packages.
